## Welcome to Xinbo Zhao's home page
I received my bachalor degree from CS at Tongji University, where I got plenty of coding and engineering training.
I had been a intern of Face++ Shanghai Research and inspired by many intelligence there. 
I am now a Master student at Tongji University, trying to make some contribution to AI engineearing&research as well as human begings.
